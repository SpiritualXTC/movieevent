Design Notes:
-------------
 - SQL DB, uses Lazy "Instantiation" when connecting.
 - Chain of Responisibility is used for:
	- Search Movies (Online -> Local)
	- Movie Details (Cached -> Local -> Online)
	- Images (Cached -> Online)
		
Bonus Features:
---------------
	- LRU Image Cache (In Memory, Limit to 10 Images -- number of movies returned by a OMDB query)
	- LRU Movie Cache (In Memory, Limit to 2 Movies -- for testing purposes)
	-* One-to-Many: Movies <-> Parties (Done as it made more sense for Firebase)
